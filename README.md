# My BattleShip Game
After class additions for our Software Engineering project


A much better and improved version of the Battlefield game. This started off as a project for my OSU CS361 course, but grew into more of a passion project.
I forked this repo from my team's previous version of this game: https://github.com/cs361fall2018/project-team-11
